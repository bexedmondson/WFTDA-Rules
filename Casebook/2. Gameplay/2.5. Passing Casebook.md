> **Skaters gain superior position on other Skaters by passing them in the counterclockwise direction. Jammers only “earn” a pass if the pass occurs while the Jammer is wearing the Star on their helmet with the stars showing.**

### Scenario C2.5.A

White Jammer is on their second trip through the Pack and has not yet earned any passes on Red Blockers. Red Pivot receives a penalty, and begins to exit the track. White Jammer passes Red Pivot while Red Pivot is still in bounds.

**Points:** One point.

**Rationale:** Blockers who have been directed to the Penalty Box but are still touching in bounds (including straddling) can still be scored upon as if they had not been penalized. White Jammer earns a pass on penalized Red Pivot by gaining superior position before Red Pivot exits the track.

**Keep in Mind:** If there were other Red Blockers in the Penalty Box, earning a pass on Red Pivot would also result in earned passes on those penalized Red Blockers.
