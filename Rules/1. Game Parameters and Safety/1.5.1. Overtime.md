**If the game ends with the score tied, the second period will be extended by at least one additional Jam.** This Overtime Jam is like any other Jam, with two exceptions:

- No Lead Jammer is declared
- Both Jammers begin scoring on their first trip through the Pack (each Jammer is in position to lap the opposing Blockers on their first earned pass of those Blockers)

More Jams will be added in this manner until a Jam ends with the score no longer tied.
