**Initiating a block is legal when a Skater is moving counterclockwise, in play, upright, and in bounds during a Jam using Legal Contact Zones.** Other contact may be dangerous because it is unexpected.

Accordingly, Skaters cannot initiate a block while down, out of bounds, out of play, airborne, stopped, or skating clockwise. Skaters also cannot initiate a block on opponents who are down, fully out of bounds, or out of play. Skaters may initiate a block on an opponent who is straddling the track boundary, stopped, or skating clockwise.

Initiation of assists should be held to the same metrics as that of blocking, with the exception of assisting a downed teammate to return to an upright position.
