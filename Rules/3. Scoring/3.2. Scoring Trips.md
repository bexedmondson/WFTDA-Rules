> [[3.2. Scoring Trips Casebook]]

**Points are grouped by trips through the Pack.** One trip through the [[Glossary#Pack|Pack]] ends, and the next begins, when the Jammer exits the front of the [[Glossary#Engagement Zone|Engagement Zone]] (or, if no Pack can be defined, when the Jammer is more than 20 ft ahead of the foremost in-bounds member of the previous Pack). Upon completion of a trip through the Pack, the Jammer’s score for that trip can no longer be altered by dropping back to re-pass any opponents the Jammer did not score upon on that trip.

If a Jammer enters the Engagement Zone from the **front**, they return to their previous trip until they exit the Engagement Zone from the front again. A Jammer cannot, however, fall behind by more than one trip. Whenever a Jammer exits the Engagement Zone from the front, they return to their latest trip. If a Jammer falls behind their initial trip through the Pack, passes on Blockers do not count toward scoring or lapping until they return to their initial trip through the Pack.

When a Jam ends, whatever trip the Jammers are on is considered to have been “completed” by the Jam ending.
