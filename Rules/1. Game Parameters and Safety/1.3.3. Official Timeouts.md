**Officials may take a timeout in order to ensure that the game is running smoothly and correctly.** If the prior Jam ended with less than 30 seconds on the period clock, the fact that the Officials called a timeout will not necessarily result in another Jam occurring in the same manner that a Team Timeout or Official Review would. Instead, the Officials must determine whether or not there is reason to hold another Jam for that period. If the Officials determine that there is no reason to hold another Jam, both teams must be given a chance to call a Team Timeout or Official Review (if they have any remaining). If they decline, the period will end.
