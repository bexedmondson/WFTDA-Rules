> [[4.3. Penalties for Unsporting Conduct (Misconduct) Casebook]]

**All participants in a game of roller derby must be respectful of one another.** This includes but is not limited to Skaters, Team Staff, Officials, mascots, event staff, and spectators. When Skaters or Team Staff behave in an unsporting manner, their misconduct should be penalized accordingly.

Misconduct can take many forms and does not have to be intentional to be considered unsporting. Examples include, but are not limited to:
- Deceiving or ignoring Officials
- Engaging in dangerous and illegal actions that pose a substantial hazard to oneself or another
- Disrespectful contact to an Official or forceful contact which is negligent or avoidable
- Being abusive toward another person
- Failure to abide by Governing Body policies during the game pertaining to Skaters, Team Staff, and the immediate play area

Actions which seriously undermine the legitimacy of the sport or display a lack of respect for the sport, its execution, and those who contribute to it may also be penalized.
