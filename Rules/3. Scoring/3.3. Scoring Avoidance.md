> [[3.3. Scoring Avoidance Casebook]]

**Opponents can only avoid being scored upon by remaining ahead of the Jammer, or by ensuring that when they are passed, the pass is not earned.** If a Jammer completes a trip through the Pack without the opportunity to earn a pass on an opponent, the Jammer is said to have earned a pass on that opponent. This includes but is not limited to:

- Opponents who are ahead of the Engagement Zone when the Jammer completes their trip through the Pack by exiting the front of the Engagement Zone
- Opponents who are ahead of the Engagement Zone at the end of the Jam when the Jammer is on a scoring trip and ahead of the rearmost Pack Blocker
- Any [[Glossary#Not-On-the-Track (NOTT) Point|Not-On-the-Track Point]] (see [[2.5. Passing|Section 2.5]]) that the Jammer cannot earn because they complete their trip through the Pack without the opportunity to earn a pass on **any** opposing Blocker (which would earn them a pass on the off-the-track opponents)
- Opponents who are out of play behind the Pack, if a Jammer reenters the track from the Penalty Box in front of that Blocker

**If a Jammer renders themself unable to score points–for example, by committing a penalty or by removing the Star–any not-on-the-track points they would have earned while unable to score are earned once they become able to score again.** If an opponent’s action renders the Jammer unable to score–for example, a Jammer who is blocked out of bounds–the Jammer continues to score Not-On-the-Track points as usual.
