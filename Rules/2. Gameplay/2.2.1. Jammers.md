> [[2.2.1. Jammers Casebook]]

**The Jammer is denoted as the Skater in visible possession of the Jammer helmet cover (a.k.a. the Star) at the beginning of the Jam.** If a Skater is serving a penalty as their team’s Jammer, no teammate may begin the Jam in possession of the Star or behind the Jammer Line. If there is neither a Skater serving a penalty as the Jammer nor a Skater with a visible Star, then the team has failed to field a Jammer for the upcoming Jam and will be penalized accordingly. Unless they are serving a penalty, the Jammer must start the Jam on or behind the Jammer Line. Jammers may be stopped or coasting, but may not be actively gaining speed in the counterclockwise direction at the Jam-Starting Whistle.

The Star may only be carried by the Jammer wearing it on their helmet, or by that team’s Jammer or Pivot holding it in their grasp. Other Skaters may not control the Star, and the Jammer and Pivot may not hide the Star (examples include putting it in a pocket or hiding it in a uniform).

**The Jammer is the only Skater who can score points for their team** (see [[3. Scoring|Section 3]].

Jammers may also legally exit and remain outside of the Engagement Zone.
