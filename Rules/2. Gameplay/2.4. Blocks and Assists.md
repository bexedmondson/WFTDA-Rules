- [[2.4.1. Target Zones]]
- [[2.4.2. Blocking Zones]]

**“Blocking” refers to any physical contact made to an opponent, and to any movement or placement of one’s body to impede said opponent’s speed or movement, during a Jam, whether or not contact is made.** Counter-blocking is any movement towards an oncoming block by the receiving Skater designed to counteract an opponent’s block. Counter-blocking is blocking. Actions that meet the above description are considered blocking, even if accidental. Contact made to teammates is not considered blocking even if it is a disadvantage to the initiator or teammate.

All contact between opponents has an initiator, though it is possible for two or more Skaters to mutually initiate blocks against one another.

Skaters may not block or assist while out of bounds, out of play, down, stopped, or moving clockwise. Skaters also may not initiate a block on an opponent who is down, out of play, or fully out of bounds. Skaters may, however, initiate a block (or assist) on someone who is straddling, stopped, or moving in any direction (even clockwise). Skaters may not assist a teammate who is out of play or fully out of bounds; however, they may assist a downed teammate to return them to an upright position.
