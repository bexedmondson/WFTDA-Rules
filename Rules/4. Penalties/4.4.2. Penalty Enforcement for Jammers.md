> [[4.4.2. Penalty Enforcement for Jammers Casebook]]

**A Jammer may have their penalty time shortened if the other Jammer also receives a penalty.** In this case, the two Jammers serve as little time as possible so long as:

1. The two Jammers serve an equivalent amount of penalty time, per penalty
2. Whenever possible given point 1, there is at least one Jammer who is not serving a penalty

Jammers who are to be released due to the other Jammer sitting should be released immediately once the other Jammer sits. If one Jammer sits between Jams, the other Jammer should be released at the start of the next Jam. If both Jammers sit simultaneously, they will both be released immediately. If both Jammers sit between Jams, they should be released at the start of the next Jam.

If a Jammer is sent to the Box when there is no opposing Jammer (for example, because the opposing Jammer has an equipment malfunction), the Jam will end once the Jammer is seated. This ensures that there is one Jammer who is not serving a penalty.
