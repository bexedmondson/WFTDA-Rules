> [[3.4. Penalized Jammers Casebook]]

**When a Jammer is penalized, they are considered to no longer be on the track** (even if they are physically still on the track). Accordingly, a penalized Jammer cannot earn passes on any further opponents until that Jammer completes their penalty. Upon release from the Penalty Box, a Jammer returns to the same trip through the Pack, having scored on (and/or being in position to score on) the same Blockers.
