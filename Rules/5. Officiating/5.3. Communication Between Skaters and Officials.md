> [[5.3. Communication Between Skaters and Officials Casebook]]

**All communication between Skaters, Team Staff, and Officials must be respectful.**

**Officials should provide any information necessary for a Skater to know whether they are in play**, including the location of the Pack. Skaters who reasonably believe that they are in play should not be penalized for technical infractions that pertain to being out of play, unless such a warning has been given (examples include failure to return to play, to reform a Pack, or to yield after committing a false start).

**If an Official provides erroneous information to a Skater, the Skater will not be penalized for actions taken based on that information.** For example, if a Penalty Box Official releases a Skater early, the Skater will not be penalized for leaving once released. Likewise, if a Jammer calls off a Jam while their Jammer Referee is indicating that they are the Lead Jammer, said Jammer will not be penalized for calling off the Jam illegally, even if they are not in fact Lead. An absence of information provided (for example, an Official not providing a warning) is not considered erroneous.

The Head Referee may, at their discretion, limit the extent to which Skaters may communicate with Officials.
