**A team is comprised of Skaters, who must be uniquely identified by a roster number.** Each team must have a jersey of the same base color, such that uniform colors of the two teams playing are of high contrast. Roster numbers must be clearly displayed on a Skaterâ€™s back and upper arm areas. Each team must have helmet covers to clearly indicate who their Jammer and Pivot are. The Jammer and Pivot helmet covers for the two teams must be easy to differentiate.

**Skaters must wear quad-style roller skates and protective gear during play.** Inline skates are not permitted. Protective gear may not be removed during play. Protective gear may not impair or interfere with the safety or play of other Skaters, support staff, or Officials.

**Skaters who are injured during play may return to play as long as they are no longer apparently injured or bleeding.** A Skater whose injury alters the flow of the game (examples include a Jam being called off, a period clock stoppage, or a substitute being seated in the Penalty Box) may not participate during the following three Jams (extending into the following period if necessary). A Skater whose injury alters the flow of the game more than once in a period may not participate as a Skater for the rest of that period. The Head Referee **may** also declare that a team has forfeited the game if that team has five or fewer Skaters eligible to participate, or refuses to field Skaters on the track to continue play.
