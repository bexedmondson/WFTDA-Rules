**Teams and Officials may stop the period clock by calling a timeout.** Timeouts may only be called between Jams, though Officials may end a Jam in order to call an Official Timeout. The beginning of a timeout is marked by four short whistle blasts, and the end of a timeout is marked by a long rolling whistle, after which the next Jam begins as soon as possible if there is time remaining on the period clock. At most, 30 seconds may pass before the next Jam begins. The period clock starts again at the Jam-Starting Whistle.

There are three types of timeouts.
