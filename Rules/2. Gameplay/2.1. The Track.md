**The track must conform to the standardized dimensions of the WFTDA Track Specifications.** The track must be flat, clean, and suitable for roller skating. The track must be marked by a boundary that stands in high contrast to the floor. The boundary counts as part of the track (the boundary is “in bounds”) and may not vary in width around the track.

The track boundary, the Pivot Line, and the Jammer Line may be of any pattern or color so long as they clearly mark the edge of the track.

Near the track, an area must be marked out for each team (the Team Bench Area) and for the Penalty Box. The boundary in these cases must also be high contrast and counts as part of the relevant area. For example, the boundary for the Penalty Box counts as part of the Penalty Box. Only Skaters who are actively serving a penalty may enter the Penalty Box Area.
