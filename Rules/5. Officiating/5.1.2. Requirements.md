**Each game must also staff enough Officials to effectively track the state of the game such that the rules can be enforced in real time.** The number and position of Officials may vary based on available technology and the limitations of the venue, but the following information must be available upon request:
- The Official Score
- The Official Jam Time
- The Official Period Time
- Which Skaters have been assessed how many penalties, and which have been served
- Which Skaters are not allowed to skate (for example, due to expulsion, fouling out, or having a Jam called for their injury)
- How long a given Skater has been seated for each penalty

Individual Officials may be assigned to multiple tasks so long as this does not threaten the accuracy of the above information.
