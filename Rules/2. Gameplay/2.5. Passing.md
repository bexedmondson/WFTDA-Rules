**Skaters gain superior position on other Skaters by passing them in the counterclockwise direction.**

Passing another Skater refers to moving such that one Skater’s center of mass (as demarcated by their hips) moves from behind another Skater’s center of mass to ahead of it.

**Jammers only “earn” a pass if the pass occurs while the Jammer is wearing the Star on their helmet with the stars showing.** All earned passes count as passes. Passes are only “earned” if:

- The Jammer is upright and in-bounds during the pass, or
- Another Skater skates behind the in-bounds Jammer, giving up their position

As soon as a Jammer earns a pass on an opposing Blocker, they also earn a pass on any opponents who are “not on the track”–meaning that they are not part of active gameplay for some reason–and who cease to be part of active gameplay prior to the completion of the Jammer’s scoring trip. This includes a Skater who:

- Is sent to or serving time in the Penalty Box
- Leaves the track due to injury
- Leaves the track temporarily to fix equipment or skates
- Was not part of the Jam in the first place (because their team did not field the maximum number of Skaters)
- Returns to active gameplay behind the Jammer

A Skater who passes someone while airborne is considered to be “in bounds” if they are in bounds when they leave the floor and the first contact they make upon landing is in bounds. A Skater who passes someone while airborne is considered to be “upright” if the Skater is upright when they leave the floor, and if the first contact they make upon landing is with their skate to the track.
