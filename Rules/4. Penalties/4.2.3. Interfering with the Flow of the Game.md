> [[4.2.3. Interfering with the Flow of the Game Casebook]]

**All efforts should be made by teams and Officials to ensure that the period clock runs according to the rules of the game, and that Jams start and end as specified in the rules.** Any inappropriate action that interferes with the game—including causing the period clock to stop, preventing a Jam from starting, or ending a Jam prematurely—should be penalized. Examples of inappropriate actions include, but are not limited to:
- Skaters queued for the Penalty Box not on the track at the Jam start
- No Blockers from one team on the track at the Jam start
- All Blockers from one team entirely out of position at the Jam start
- Either team not fielding a Jammer for the Jam
- A team fielding too many Skaters during a Jam which results in an advantage that cannot be removed by the removal of the extra Skater(s)
- A team successfully requesting a Team Timeout when they have none remaining
- A team member who is neither the Captain nor the Designated Alternate successfully requesting a Team Timeout or Official Review

Officials and Skaters should work together to ensure that the game flows according to the rules.
