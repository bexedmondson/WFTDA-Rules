> [[4.2.1. Illegal Positioning Casebook]]

**Since all Blockers are unable to block when a Pack cannot be defined,** if a Skater’s illegal action destroys the Pack, or if a Skater’s actions prevent or delay the reformation of a Pack, that Skater should be penalized.

**It is illegal to adopt or maintain a position in which one cannot be blocked.** Skaters may not intentionally leave the track, nor may Blockers intentionally leave the Engagement Zone. While there are many legal actions that would cause a Skater to be put into an illegal position (for example, out of bounds or out of play), intentionally adopting such a position should be penalized. It is legal for Jammers and Pivots to leave the track to retrieve an out-of-bounds helmet cover. A Skater who is illegally positioned must immediately act to regain a legal position.

If a Skater has reason to believe that they are legally positioned (even though they are not), or has reason to believe that they cannot legally return to a legal position, they must be warned before being assessed a penalty for failing to return to a legal position.

If a Skater is not legally positioned at the start of a Jam, the Skater should immediately yield position to everybody in the vicinity. Failing to do so after a warning is considered to be intentionally maintaining an illegal position and should be penalized accordingly.
