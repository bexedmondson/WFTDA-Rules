**The Pivot is a Blocker, and is denoted as the Skater in possession of the Pivot helmet cover (a.k.a. the Stripe) at the Jam-Starting Whistle.** The Pivot wearing the Stripe with the stripe showing has several additional abilities that other Blockers do not.

- The Pivot may become their teamâ€™s Jammer (see [[2.2.4. Passing the Star|Section 2.2.4]].
- The Pivot may control the Star (pick it up, move it, etc.) even if they are not the Jammer; for example, to recover it and return it to the Jammer.
- The Pivot may begin a Jam while touching the Pivot Line.

When not wearing the Stripe with the stripe showing, the Pivot cannot utilize these additional abilities.
