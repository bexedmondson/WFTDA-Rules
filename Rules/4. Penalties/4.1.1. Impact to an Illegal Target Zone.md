> [[4.1.1. Impact to an Illegal Target Zone Casebook]]

**Making contact to an Illegal Target Zone should be penalized based on the impact it has on the target** (see [[2.4.1. Target Zones|Section 2.4.1]]).

Illegal Target Zones include:
- Back of the body, including the back of the buttocks and the back of the thighs
- Head, down to the collarbone
- Below mid-thigh

For safety reasons, avoidable forceful contact to the back, or any forceful contact to the head or neck should be penalized regardless of impact.

A Skater suddenly presenting an Illegal Target Zone to an opponent, giving that opponent no reasonable opportunity to avoid illegal contact, is considered to be initiating with that target zone.
