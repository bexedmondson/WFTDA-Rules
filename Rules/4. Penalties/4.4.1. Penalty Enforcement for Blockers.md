> [[4.4.1. Penalty Enforcement for Blockers Casebook]]

**No more than two Blockers for the same team may sit in the Penalty Box at the same time.** If a third Blocker reports to the Penalty Box while two Blockers for their team are seated, the third Blocker will be placed in queue and instructed to return to play. If a Blocker is standing in the Penalty Box, another Blocker may sit in the open seat.

**A Blocker in queue may return to the Penalty Box when there is space in the Penalty Box, unless doing so would destroy the Pack.** A Blocker must immediately return if instructed to do so by an Official. Once a Blocker in queue returns to the track, they should be treated like any other unpenalized Blocker.
