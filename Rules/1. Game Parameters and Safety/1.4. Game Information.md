**Critical game information must be displayed in a manner that is highly visible to Teams, Officials, and spectators.** This displayed critical game information is considered official, and must include, at a minimum:
- The period clock
- The Jam clock
- The Official Score

Errors in timing or score should be updated as quickly as possible. If an error persists for an extended period of time, it should be corrected only if the correction itself would have minimal impact on the game.
