> [[2.3. Engagement Zone and Pack]]

> **The Pack is the largest group of in-bounds and upright Blockers in proximity and containing members from both teams. The Engagement Zone is the area in which it is legal for Blockers to engage or be engaged.**

### Scenario C2.3.A

> [!note] Scenario
> ![[c-gameplay-pack-blocked-out.png]]

Red Blocker 1 blocks White Blocker 1 out of bounds.

**Outcome:** No Pack. No penalty. White Blocker 1 must return in bounds to reform the Pack as soon as they legally can do so, and Red Blocker 1 must skate counterclockwise to allow White Blocker 1 to do so.

**Rationale:** Because there were no White Blockers within 10 ft (3.05 m) of any Red Blockers, no Pack could be defined. All Blockers must work together to allow a Pack to reform as quickly as possible.

### Scenario C2.3.B

> [!note] Scenario
> ![[c-gameplay-front-skates-forward.png]]

The Red wall skates forward slowly while the White Blockers stand still.

**Outcome:** “No Pack” is declared. No penalty.

**Rationale:** The Red Blockers’ slow skating provided opportunity for White Pivot to maintain a Pack, so the Red Blockers should not be penalized. White Pivot is not required to maintain the Pack, but is required to work to reform a Pack if there is no Pack. Also, White Pivot is prohibited from making sudden movements that destroy the Pack.

**Keep in Mind:** If, instead of moving forward, the Red Blockers stayed still while White Pivot skated backward or took a knee, White Pivot should be penalized. Roller derby is played in the counterclockwise direction, so clockwise movement is held to a different standard than counterclockwise movement, and taking a knee is always a sudden action. Subtle movements such as shifting one’s weight while standing should not be considered sudden actions.

### Scenario C2.3.C

> [!note] Scenario
> ![[c-gameplay-pack-stretch.png]]

In the above image, Red 3 and White Pivot are more than 10 ft (3.05 m) apart, as are Red 1 and White 3. Accordingly, the Pack is comprised of White Pivot, Red 2, White 1, and White 2. Red 1 and Red Pivot are out of play.

The Pack would be comprised of the following Skaters if the following Blockers fell down:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|White 2|White 1, Red 2, White Pivot|
|White 1|No Pack. Red 3 and White 3 could be a Pack of two, but so could White Pivot and Red 2.|
|Red 2|White 3 and Red 3|
|White Pivot|White 1, White 2, Red 2|
|Red 3 or anybody ahead of them|The Pack does not change.|
