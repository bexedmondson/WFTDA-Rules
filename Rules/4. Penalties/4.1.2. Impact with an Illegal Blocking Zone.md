> [[4.1.2. Impact with an Illegal Blocking Zone Casebook]]

**Making contact with an Illegal Blocking Zone should be penalized based on the impact it has on the target** (see [[2.4.2. Blocking Zones|Section 2.4.2]]).

Using an Illegal Blocking Zone also has sufficient impact to warrant a penalty if:
- The contact puts an opponent significantly off balance;
- The contact significantly alters an opponent’s trajectory or speed (for example, significantly holding them back);
- The contact with an opponent allows the Skater to maintain an in-bounds position (that otherwise would not have been maintained); or
- The contact with an opponent allows the Skater to maintain an upright position (that otherwise would not have been maintained).

Illegal Blocking Zones include:
- Head, down to the collarbone
- Forearm, from the point of the elbow to the fingertips
- Legs, from below mid-thigh to the wheels of the skate

For safety reasons, any forceful contact initiated with the head or neck, intentional use of the head or neck to positionally block, or intentional and forceful jabbing with elbows or strikes with knees should be penalized regardless of impact.

Forearms are considered a Legal Blocking Zone when they are held close against the initiator’s torso.
