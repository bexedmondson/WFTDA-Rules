- [[4.4.1. Penalty Enforcement for Blockers]]
- [[4.4.2. Penalty Enforcement for Jammers]]

**Upon completion of the correct verbal cue and hand signal from an Official, the penalized Skater must immediately leave the track.** Upon sitting in any seat in the Penalty Box, the Skater’s penalty time begins. Skaters serve 30 seconds of Jam time for each penalty assessed to them. The final 10 seconds of their penalty time must be served while standing.

- If a Skater stands early, their time stops until they are seated again.   
- If a Skater does not stand in a manner that makes it clear to Officials, Skaters, and spectators that they are serving their final 10 seconds, their timing stops until they stand.

If a Skater sits in the Penalty Box between Jams, their time does not start until the beginning of the following Jam.

If a Skater is assessed a penalty but unable to serve it—for example, due to an injury or an equipment malfunction—a substitute may serve in their place once the Jam ends. In this case, the Skater who was unable to serve their own penalty may not skate for the following three Jams.

Skaters may remove their mouthguard, but no other protective gear, while seated in the Penalty Box. Skaters must replace their mouthguard prior to leaving the Penalty Box.

**Nobody may enter the Penalty Box except for Officials, and Skaters who are serving penalties.**
