**A game lasts for 60 minutes of play, divided into two 30-minute periods with a halftime between them.** Periods are broken into [[Glossary#Jam|Jams]], which are the basic unit of play for roller derby.

**A Jam can last up to two minutes.** Jams may be called off prior to two minutes as part of gameplay, as described below. Each Jam starts with a single short whistle blast, and finishes at the end of a series of four short whistle blasts. At least 30 seconds must elapse between Jams. More than 30 seconds may not elapse unless a timeout is called.

**A period starts on the Jam-Starting Whistle of the first Jam for that period.** The period clock does not stop between Jams unless a timeout is called. If the period clock reaches zero before the next Jam has started, the period ends at that moment; otherwise, the period ends at the conclusion of the final Jam for the period.

If a Jam is called off due to officiating discretion (see [[5.2. Duties|Section 5.2]]) or there is an officiating error that potentially impacted the outcome (as in winner/loser) of the game, and there are less than 30 seconds remaining on the period clock at the end of the game (including when the period clock has expired), an additional Jam may be run at the discretion of the Head Referee. This additional Jam will have the same form (Overtime or not; see [[1.5.1. Overtime|Section 1.5.1]]) as the Jam that ended and be part of the same period.
