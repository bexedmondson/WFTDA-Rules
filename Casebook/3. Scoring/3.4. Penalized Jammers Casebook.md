> [[3.4. Penalized Jammers]]

> **When a Jammer is penalized, they are considered to no longer be on the track.**

### Scenario C3.4.A

Red Jammer completes their first trip through the Pack and has not passed any opposing Blockers when they commit two penalties in quick succession. They are sent to the Penalty Box for 60 seconds, during which all four opposing Blockers also commit penalties and are sent to the Box. Red Jammer returns to the rear of the Pack, but the Jam ends before they can pass any opponents.

**Outcome:** Zero points.

**Rationale:** Red Jammer did not earn a pass on any opposing Blockers, so they were not eligible to earn any Not-On-the-Track points.

**Keep in Mind:** If Red Jammer had earned a pass on any opposing Blockers before their penalty was served, they would have earned points for the other opposing Blockers upon returning to the track.

**Keep in Mind:** If Red Jammer had earned a pass on an opposing Blocker once they returned from serving their penalty but before the Jam ended, they would have also earned a point on any opposing Blockers still seated in the Box or any opposing Blockers returning from the Box behind Red Jammer.
