**Jammers score one point every time they lap an opposing Blocker.** A Jammer laps a Blocker if they pass that opponent twice in a row (without that opponent having passed that Jammer), but score a point only if the lapping pass is earned (see [[2.5. Passing|[Section 2.5]]). If an opponent is lapped but a point is not scored (because the lapping pass was not earned), the Jammer may yield position to that opponent and re-pass them, earning a pass, to score on that opponent.

Only Blockers can be scored upon. All Blockers are considered to be on the same trip, including former Jammers who have passed the Star.
