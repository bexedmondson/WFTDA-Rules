> [[2.2.2. Lead Jammer Casebook]]

**The Lead Jammer is the first Jammer who establishes superior position to the foremost in-play Blocker, having already earned a pass on all Blockers excluding those ahead of the Engagement Zone** (see [[2.5. Passing|Section 2.5]]). When one Jammer is determined to be the Lead Jammer, this is indicated by two short whistle blasts. A Jammer becomes ineligible to earn Lead during a Jam if they commit a penalty during that Jam, exit the front of the [[Glossary#Engagement Zone|Engagement Zone]] without having earned Lead on their initial trip, remove their helmet cover, or have their helmet cover removed by a teammate. If both Jammers qualify for Lead at the same moment (for example, the foremost Blocker goes out of play), the foremost Jammer at that moment will be declared Lead. Only Skaters who begin the Jam as Jammers may become Lead (so a Pivot who receives the Star cannot become Lead).

The Lead Jammer will lose their Lead Jammer status if they commit a penalty, intentionally remove the Star once it is on, or have the Star intentionally removed from their head by a teammate.

**The Lead Jammer is the only Skater who may call off a Jam before the full two minutes elapse.** The Lead Jammer calls off the Jam by repeatedly placing their hands on their hips.
