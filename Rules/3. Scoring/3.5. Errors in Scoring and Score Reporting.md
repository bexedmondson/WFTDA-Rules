**The Official Score is that which is reported and visible to teams, Officials, and spectators.** If a point is awarded (or denied) in error, or if a Jammer Referee has reported a score incorrectly, the score may be corrected no later than the end of the Jam after the one in which the error occurred. If there are fewer than 2 minutes in the game remaining on the period clock, score corrections must be made before the start (rather than the end) of the Jam after which the error occurred.

However, points awarded (or denied) correctly, given the information available at the time, may not be taken away (or awarded) later. For example, a Jammer who exits the Engagement Zone and is awarded four points has earned those points, even if upon review they were found to have committed a penalty two trips prior (and thus would not have been able to earn those points).
